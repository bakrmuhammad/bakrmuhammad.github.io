            <h1>Everyone has their own style.</h1>
            <p>Your style may be simple, elegant, complex, disoriented, ordered, or eclectic. Every single person is unique. Every job is unique.</p> 
            <p>In design, there is no limit to how creativity can be expressed due to the sheer massiveness of possiblities that each project presents.</p>
            <p>My goals in design aren't about showing all the nifty things I can do using photoshop, illustrator or whatever. My goals are to use my creativity and ability to bring the best possible way to illustrate information to whoever the audience.</p>
            <p>The art found in newspapers and magazines and on websites is reaching places that are becoming more innovative and engaging. As print media moves toward a more complete integration with the web, new designs and ideas are spreading throughout the industry. </p>
            <p>The goal of this project is to give advice on how to look at your own style as a framework that can be molded into any structure needed for any type of assignment.</p>
            <h2>What Makes good design?</h2>
            <p>I don't know, but I know it when I see it.</p>
            <p>There is no ten commandments of good design. And if there is, don't worry about it, because whoever made it probably based it off their own style and the style of really good people.</p>
            <p>Your design will be good as long as the function matches the structure.</p>
            <p>John Kaplan has taught design classes at the University of Florida for 15 years, and he told me that good design comes from honoring the trade.</p>
            <p>"A good designer needs to be a student of the craft," he says. "To be excellent, you need to what excellence is. So you always need to be looking at good design."</p>
    
            <h3>What to expect from design as a career</h3>
            <p>Every job is different, but while talking with Kaplan, the key to first making a career and entering the field is to make connections.</p>
            <p>"You need to find good mentors, and try to find the best in the business," he says. "Just try to find someone that remembes that they to needed a hand up along the way."</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4> What makes bad design?</h4>
            <p>Forcing an idea onto content that doesn't fit. Work with what you have. Don't try to come up with a template for certain types of jobs, because you may not always be able to fill the template, or you may over fill the template or idea and have to needlessly cut content.</p>
