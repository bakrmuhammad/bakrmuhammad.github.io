            <h1>C. R. A. P.</h1>
            <p>C.R.A.P. is a basic design principle that you should take into account when editing your design. Looking at you design through C.R.A.P. principles will allow you to make sure your content is clear, engaging, and at the very least, pleasing to look at.</p>
            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p>Now I could bore you with a long explanation of the color wheel and color theory and blah blah blah. But that's so boring. Mainly because contrast can deal with things outside of color. Contrast can refer to font choices as well as color. Making sure these elements fit together is crucial to understanding the principle of contrast.</p>
            <p> On the topic of color, contrast has less to do with having it, and more to do with making sure that you know when to use it. Take a look a figure 1.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="img/contrast_shades.png" title="Contrast Fig 1." alt="4 Shades of Blue" /> 
                <figcaption>Fig1</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p>Here We have 4 shades of blue. Obviously, the one's with the greatest contrast are between the darkest and lightest shades.</p> 
            <p>But the rule of contrast doesn't mean only use dark and light shades, I mean look at the figure, it's pretty neat to look at and the contrast here is fairly minimal.</p>
            <p>Considering contrast means to determine how the elements in a design relate to each other. Do independent  elements appear to be independent? How to make elements independent? Colors, size, styles, etc.</p>
            <p> Figuring out the relation that you want to have between elements is the first step to meeting this requirement.</p>
            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Repetition is essential to making a group of elements or pages maintain the relationship between them. Repetition can be simply using the same font over and over again. For instance, the body copy of this page is the same that 'Roboto Slab' font that you will find throughout my site.</p>
            <p>It is also important to know when to not have repetition. If this entire page was in Roboto Slab, that would look very amateur and lame.</p>

        </figure>
            <h4>Alignment</h4>
            <p>No brainer, make sure things align in some way. Having elements askew is very amateur. My rule of thumb is that if elements are near each other and are near the same size, align it. At the base, elements should align with similar elements.</p>
            <h5>Proximity</h5>
            <p>Every one of these acronyms revolve around being aware of the relationship between the elements in the page. Proximity deals with the relation between the distances of elements.</p>
